# Seed

A self-improving Android app. The APK is an immutable shell with four
screens (App, Chat, Shell, Settings). An embedded Linux runtime
(proot + Alpine) hosts a Python orchestrator that drives two `pi` agent
instances — a "middle-man" for intent and a "worker" for building — and
the worker mutates a Flask + SQLite web app shown in a WebView. By the
end of day 1, the user has the web app they asked for.

## Status

**v0.1 bootstrap.** The repo currently contains:

- `backend/` — Python package (`seed_backend`) for the FastAPI orchestrator,
  pi runner, and Flask subprocess manager.
- `webapp/` — Flask app (`seed_app`) that the worker mutates.
- `android/` — Compose shell that extracts and starts the embedded runtime.
- `scripts/` — architecture-aware runtime build and validation tooling.
- `docs/plans/` — full design and phased implementation plans.

## Quick start (host dev)

Requires Python 3.11+ (3.12 is what we test on) and the
`pi` CLI on `PATH` (v0.79+).

```bash
# Create a venv (PEP 668 system Pythons require this)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install both packages in editable mode
pip install -U pip hatchling
pip install -e "backend/[dev]"
pip install -e "webapp/[dev]"

# Smoke test (no API key needed — uses fake pi fixtures)
pytest backend/ webapp/ -v

# Run the dev server (orchestrator + Flask webapp)
./backend/scripts/dev.sh
# → curl http://127.0.0.1:7777/health

# Open a real chat session (Phase 3 demo, no API key needed)
.venv/bin/python backend/scripts/demo_phase3.py
# → streams middleman_line → worker_line → complete → app_reload
```

### Running the real agent loop

The orchestrator uses real `pi` when started via
`./backend/scripts/dev.sh`. You need an API key for the
provider/model in `.pi/agent/settings.json` (default:
`opencode-go` / `deepseek-v4-flash`). Set it in your
shell — **never commit it**:

```bash
export OPENCODE_API_KEY="sk-..."
./backend/scripts/dev.sh
```

See [`docs/pi-config.md`](docs/pi-config.md) for the full
configuration story (local `.pi/agent/`, env var
overrides, why no `auth.json` in the repo).

## Android runtime workflow

An APK bundles one runtime architecture at a time. Runtime generation defaults
to arm64, whether invoked directly with `./scripts/build-runtime.sh` or through
`make runtime`.

For the repository's x86_64 Android emulator, build matching assets explicitly
before building or running the APK:

```bash
make runtime RUNTIME_ARCH=x86_64
make build
make run
```

For an arm64 physical-device build:

```bash
make runtime RUNTIME_ARCH=arm64
make build
```

`make run` never starts the large runtime build automatically. It validates the
packaged proot first and fails on a missing, invalid, or mismatched binary with
the explicit matching `make runtime RUNTIME_ARCH=...` command. See
[`docs/build-runtime.md`](docs/build-runtime.md) for Docker prerequisites,
architecture switching, and generated-asset versioning.
